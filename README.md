## TODO

### Repository structure
- [x] Add requirements.txt --- 24/05/2021
- [x] Add a utils.py file --- 24/05/2021

### Theory
- [x] Write solution to open loop dual species NMRG dynamics. --- 30/05/2021
- [ ] Write solution to closed loop dual species NMRG dynamics.


### Simulations
- [x] Single specie without magnetic noise $B_{noise}=0, \omega_r>0$. --- 2/06/2021
- [x] Single specie dynamic-range simulation with and without magnetic noise $B_{noise}\leq 0, \omega_r>0$ . --- 2/06/2021
- [x] Dual species with magnetic noise $B_{noise}>0, \omega_r>0$. --- 6/06/2021
- [ ] compute PSD of $B_{noise}>0, \omega_r>0$ and find the connection to T_2.
- [ ] Dual species with magnetic noise $B_{noise}>0, \omega_r>0 and smooth magetic drift. Explore for which drift size the simulation breaks (there is no noise cancellation).
