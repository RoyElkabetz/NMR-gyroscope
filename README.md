## TODO

### Repository structure
#### 24/05/2021
- [x] Add requirements.txt
- [x] Add a utils.py file

### Theory
- [x] Write solution to open loop dual species NMRG dynamics.
- [ ] Write solution to closed loop dual species NMRG dynamics.


### Simulations
- [ ] Single specie without magnetic noise $B_{noise}=0, \omega_r>0$.
- [ ] Dual species with magnetic noise $B_{noise}>0, \omega_r>0$.
- [ ] Dual species with magnetic noise $B_{noise}>0, \omega_r>0 and smooth magetic drift. Explore for which drift size the simulation breaks (there is no noise cancellation).
